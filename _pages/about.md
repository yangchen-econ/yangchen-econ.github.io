Hello! I am a PhD student in Economics since 2022 at the [Department of Economics](https://www.unil.ch/de/en/home.html), HEC Lausanne, University of Lausanne, under the supervision of Prof. [Bettina KLAUS](https://www.bklaus.net/).

My research interests focus on matching theory, fair allocation, market design.

I am currently visiting [CREST](https://crest.science/)-Institut Polytechnique de Paris, hosted by Prof. [Julien COMBE](https://sites.google.com/site/combeju/home) and Prof. [Yuki TAMURA](https://sites.google.com/view/yukitamura).
